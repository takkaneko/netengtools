# netengtools
Examples of network automation tools written in python3.4+
To try my tools, please download all the *.py files and run boreasprov.py. Sample data can be found in the comment areas of
networksid.py and locationcode.py both of which define custom classes necessary for my tools to work.

Most of the functions are defined in hafwl2l3prov.py.
